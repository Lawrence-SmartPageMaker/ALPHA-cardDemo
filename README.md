# ALPHA-cardDemo
The js powered project is proof of concept for editting something like Anki study cards.

This stand alone web app actually has a page called HardWired. That page gives
you a choice of starting from one of three datasets which give you an idea of
how the program works.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tiny</strong> - Gets you started with just four records so you can see what it is doing</li>
  <li><strong>Mixed</strong> - Gives an idea what happens after you added two temporary fields</li>
  <li><strong>Standard Run</strong> - The demo with information in it about 20 cards in a simple quiz about animals</li>
</ul>

The comments for the current code state are meta lines in the meta lines at
the top of the degaultAlpha file.
